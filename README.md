I work at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) on [HCB](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship), developing [awesome financial tools](https://hcb.hackclub.com/hq) for high schoolers to get [501(c)(3) nonprofit status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization) for free.
The repo is private (we handle a lot of money!) so most of my commits are hidden. It's a full-stack [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) app, but I'm most comfortable writing [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which I use for most of my personal projects - for example my website; [malted.dev](https://malted.dev)

I move around a lot, but I'm currently here ⬇️
